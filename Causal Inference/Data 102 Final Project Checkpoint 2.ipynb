    "Our study has one primary flaw: the confounding variable of income. Although the literature says definitively that income is highly correlated with race and has a causal relationship with opinions on police brutality, the confounding variable that we controlled for here is poorly organized for this use case. The income variable is badly binned, with a majority of individuals self-identifying a salary above 25000 for obvious reasons. The question asked in the survey was clearly more interested in those living in poverty, since there were several bins that divided up income levels between $0-25000 in annual salary. As a result, the unconfoundedness assumption likely does not completely hold in our study, since the income bins only limited matches in respondents who earned an income far below the poverty line."
